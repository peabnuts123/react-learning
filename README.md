# react-learning üåà
Learning React (with TypeScript) by building a small application. I have chosen to write a project management tool of sorts, as it can be as comprehensive or as simple as you like. 

Unlike other repos I have, I have not written this one as a tutorial, but rather an example of a functioning code base with (I hope) a sane workflow.

## Workflow ‚öôÔ∏è
I have designed this workflow myself based on research sourced from around the internet; some from official docs, some from various recommendations from users on StackOverflow, and the rest from various dedicated developers' blog posts. I have designed this workflow to depend on as few workflow-assisting-packages as possible, as I wanted the workflow to be simple and not abstract-away functionality so as to be hard to understand.

The application is written in TypeScript 2 using React and Bootstrap 3, transpiled to ES5 using Babel. The application is compiled and wired together using Webpack 2. There are two separate webpack configurations; one for the application's dependencies (such as React or Bootstrap) ‚Äì the "libraries" configuration ‚Äì and one for the application itself. All libraries are bundled into separate files (which are referenced in `index.html`), while all application code is bundled into a single `.min.js` file. 

The structure of the application is such that each module or component may be as abstract and isolated as possible, such that each file only represents a single purpose or function. The webpack workflows are in-place to "wire" the project together so that high-modularity in the source does not lead to a messy output project.

## Commands ‚å®Ô∏è

The project has a few different commands for development:

| Command                       | Purpose |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| `build-libraries`             | Builds all library bundles (React, bootstrap, etc). |
| `build-application`           | Builds all application code into a single bundle. |
| `build-application:live`      | Builds all application bundles, then watches `src/` directory for changes and recompiles when any are detected. |
| `build-all`                   | Equivalent to `build-libraries; build-application`. |
| `serve`                       | Hosts a simple debug server for testing the application. |

These are npm scripts so run them with `npm run $commandName` or `yarn run $commandName` if you have yarn (which you should). You can also see other various (less-useful) scripts in `package.json`.
